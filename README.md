# Shift Register
This is an implementation of a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) in Java. A LFSR is a register of bits. It performs discrete step operations that shifts all bits to one position left and replaces the vacated bit by the exclusive or of the bit shifted off and the bit at a given tap position in the register.

This project was just done out of curiousity.
